    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
      Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy explains how our app
      collects and uses information.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Collection</h2>
    <p>
      Our app does not collect any personal information from users. The content
      posted or displayed within the app is based on the device ID and is not
      linked to any specific individual.
    </p>

    <h2>Use of Device ID</h2>
    <p>
      The app may use the device ID for internal purposes such as identifying
      unique users anonymously. This helps us improve the app and provide
      personalized content without compromising your privacy.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We do not share any personally identifiable information with third
      parties.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take reasonable precautions to protect the information collected by our
      app. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic
      storage is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update our privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of
      any changes by posting the new privacy policy on this page.
    </p>
